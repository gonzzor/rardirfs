RarDirFs 0.1
============
Mount a directory read only where all rar archives are hidden and their files
are shown instead. Beside this it can also filter files and flatten out
directories.

The big difference from other fuse based rar archive file systems is that
RarDirFs doesn't unpack the whole file when you open it, it just read directly
from the archive. No extra storage, no extra time, just as you normally would.
Because of this design some limitations arose, see under Limitations.

Example
-------
Assume we have two archives that contains one file each, say foo and bar. We
have stored them in separate directories. We also have one file we don't want
to show, foobar.

Using this srcdir
srcdir/foobar
srcdir/Archive1/foo.rar
srcdir/Archive1/foo.r01
srcdir/Archive1/foo.r02
srcdir/Archive2/bar.rar
srcdir/Archive2/bar.r01
srcdir/Archive2/bar.r02

This gives us the following structure
mountdir/
mountdir/foo
mountdir/bar

In the example above we could have used this command line
rardirfs srcdir mountdir -o flatten=flatten.txt,filter=filter.txt

Where flatten.txt would look like this
# Don't show the folders Archive, show there content instead
^Archive\d+$

And filter.txt
# I don't like foobar
^foobar$

The filter and flatten files
----------------------------
These files can be used to customize the behaviour of RarDirFs. It's a plain
text file where each line contains a regular expression compatible with Python
re module. Lines starting with # are ignored. Remember that there will be no
way to differentiate between a file or a directory.

If an entry would match a pattern in both files, it will be filtered.

Known Limitations
-----------------
* RarDirFs does not verify that the RAR archive is correct or complete.
* Compressed archives are support by using the unrar command.

Requirements
------------
Currently it only depends on fuse-python.
For compressed archives, unrar is also needed.
